# PAPER-10 execution card

- Branch: `cloudflare-deploy`
- Card: PAPER-10 — external release, deployment and live acceptance
- Candidate source commit: `455ae849c572aa285cc752a10e21fd69f031b18d`
- Runtime decision: the user explicitly approved `zhangbot` as the sole
  trusted Paper Processor host, overriding the earlier Cloudflare-managed
  runtime assumption. No other host or replica is in scope.
- External authorization: the user explicitly authorized production D1
  migrations `0017`–`0021`, the minimum Edge/R2/Processor configuration,
  zhangbot service installation, Edge/Processor deployment, and authenticated
  live acceptance. Existing Redis, Redis Relay, and Cloudflared services remain
  outside the change scope.
- Local outcome: the fixed-source contract, PubMed/approved-URL boundaries,
  Python 3.10 virtualenv delivery definition, pinned dependencies, fixed Edge
  URL validation, unique instance identity, hardened systemd-user unit, and
  operator runbook are implemented and tested.
- External outcome at this checkpoint: not yet run. The next action is the
  strict read-only Cloudflare and zhangbot preflight after source-control
  backup. No Cloudflare, R2, Processor, Redis, Secret, or zhangbot write has
  occurred in this local phase.

## Required release acceptance

- [ ] Re-run read-only target, artifact, Cloudflare, D1, R2, zhangbot, and
  runtime preflight.
- [ ] Apply additive D1 migrations `0017` through `0021` in order and read
  back each migration marker and required table/index.
- [ ] Configure the fixed Edge Processor ID and shared secret; transfer only
  the Processor token to the mode-0600 zhangbot env file without logging it.
- [ ] Deploy the reviewed Python virtualenv release and one systemd-user
  service without changing Redis, Relay, or Cloudflared.
- [ ] Deploy the reviewed Edge and verify readiness, Processor connect/poll,
  lease/fencing, retries, cancellation, object publication, and restart
  recovery against real D1/R2.
- [ ] Run authenticated live search, supported PDF materialization, parsing,
  page text, image retrieval/analysis, durable tool history/refresh recovery,
  provider egress, isolation, invalid identifiers, stale leases, duplicate
  finalize, cancellation, malformed input, and oversized/SSRF negatives.
- [ ] Capture deployment identifiers, migration results, live exit codes, safe
  health/readiness output, rollback reference, and post-release secret scan.
